        I'm an adventurer, so I spend most of my free time traveling or planning a trip. I love extreme sports like wakesurfing, and snowboarding, which I discovered when I lived in Japan and improved when I lived in the United States.
        I practice karate since I was 3 years old, having more than 30 titles in national and international championships. I also did many years of horseback riding. Nowadays, I consider myself a mountaineer and I love camping. In the past two years, I have visited Sweden, Norway, Chile, Argentina, Japan and Ecuador. In the last vacation, I spent 15 days camping and climbing mountains in El Chalten, Torres del Paine and Atacama.
        I have three beautiful feline daughters: Fuma√ßa ('Smoky'), Canela ('Cinnamon') and Sacola ('Baggy').
I am now planning a motorhome trip through New Zealand or Canada, in particular Banff National Park (depending on the pandemic). I'm also very interested in politics.
