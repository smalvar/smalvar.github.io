      <p>
        I am an adventurer, so you can call me for any trip that involves some extreme sport: 
        snowboarding, wakesurfing, horseback riding. I also love camping and I'm a mountaineer, so 
        I spend most of my weekends on the mountain.
        I have three beautiful cats: Fuma√ßa (Smoke), Canela (Cinnamon) and Sacola (Baggy) and I love martial arts. I'm a Karate black belt and I've won several championships. I'm also very interested in politics.
